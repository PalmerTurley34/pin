# pin

A CLI tool for easy navigation of pinned directories

## Motivation

I wanted to build a useful CLI tool and was looking into some already existing ones. I found [pm](https://github.com/Angelmmiguel/pm), which looked especially interesting to me. I've always been frustrated when trying to change into different directories or moving files around. I built pin to help me navigate to important directories quickly and easily, and also to easily be used with other Unix commands.

## In Development

This is still a work in progress, not ready to be used.

## Commands

Expected commands to use with pin:

* pin new {name} {directory}
* pin go {name}
* pin rm {name}
* pin ls
* pin show {name}
